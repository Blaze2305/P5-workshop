# How to run the code
You can download the full zip file of p5.js [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ppsE0Le2Jq8ccdGL_YOdzPUJEY1gMk16), which has a few modifications to run better.

###### Steps to write your own script:
    1. Unzip the .rar file and copy the contents to a folder
    2. Write your p5.js code in a separate file called sketch.js ( you can name it differently but change it in index.html as well)
    3. Open index.html (or preferably have a live server running use VSCode which has live reload)
    
###### To run the code in this repository:
* You can directly run each file as is , I reccomend you have the page running while you look through the code to understand it better. All the required dependencies are already in the folder.
